            <div class="panel">
                <p>Our Blossom Beauty foundation can withstand 24 hours no cakey look, oiliness, nor fading! However, if you're planning to wear it on a regular basis (even if you're just gonna stay home), it's not suggested to wear it everyday because there are chances that you'll get your pores clogged which can result in acne. On the other hand, if you're the type to wear makeup almost everyday, daily skincare routine such as face wash, moisturizer, and sunscreen(in the morning) is a must for you! Shop now and we'll get you started on building your own routine!</p>
